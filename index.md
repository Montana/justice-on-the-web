# Justice On The Web
This site aims to document the team's technical guidance and engineering practices.

## Standards
Borrowing from Google's engineering practices, our aim within JOTW, with respect to our standards, is to always "make sure that the overall code health ...is improving over time ... [and that] all of the tools and processes of code review are designed to this end".

See Google's full [documentation](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html) on coding standards.

### Code Review
On this aspect, it seems Google has done an excellent job covering the dos and don'ts. For now we can reference their documentation, however, as a team we can discuss if there are areas in which we diverge from their documentation or are not applicable.

[The Standard of Code Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html)

TL;DR - see their section on "Principles".

### Style guide
This covers a lot of ground. For now I'm again, going to be referencing Google's documentation as a default where there are gaps but we can continue to update this section where we deviate from Google.

* [HTML/CSS/Webpack](/standards/html-css)
* [Javascript](/standards/javascript)
* [PHP](/standards/php)

We currently do not have a team style guide for using Git, however, GDS provide a useful default for us to follow:
* [Working with Git](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/source-code.html#working-with-git) (External site)

## Runbooks
Runbooks are currently located in [Confluence](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JOWJ/pages/1482326465/WordPress+Sites+Runbook)
