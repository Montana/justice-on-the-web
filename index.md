# Justice On The Web
This site aims to document the team's technical guidance and engineering practices.

## Standards
Borrowing from Google's engineering practices, our aim within JOTW, with respect to our standards, is to always "make sure that the overall code health ...is improving over time ... [and that] all of the tools and processes of code review are designed to this end".

See Google's full [documentation](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html) on coding standards.

### Languages
On the PHP front, this is still open to discussion but we are aiming to follow the [PSR standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/). Preferably, PSR12 for all PHP code, either in a theme, plugin or microservice.
* [PHP12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)

Start formatting and linting your code to this standard one option is to use [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) however, there may also be plugins for your specific code editor.

### Code Review
On this aspect, it seems Google has done an excellent job covering the dos and don'ts. For now we can reference their documentation, however, as a team we can discuss if there are areas in which we diverge from their documentation or are not applicable.

[The Standard of Code Review](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html)

TL;DR - see their section on "Principles".

### Style guide
This covers a lot of ground. For now I'm again, referencing Google's documentation where applicable but we will have to revisit this area.

* [HTML/CSS Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
* [Javascript?](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)

There is also the [JS standard](https://standardjs.com/) which we may want to follow. We'll have to have further discussions as a team on the standards around JS.

## Runbooks
Runbooks are currently located in [Confluence](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JOWJ/pages/1482326465/WordPress+Sites+Runbook)
