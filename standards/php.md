# PHP

On the PHP front, this is still open to discussion but we are aiming to follow the [PSR standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/). Preferably, PSR12 for all PHP code, either in a theme, plugin or microservice.
* [PHP12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)

Start formatting and linting your code to this standard one option is to use [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) however, there may also be plugins for your specific code editor.
