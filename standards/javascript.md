# Javascript

There is also the [JS standard](https://standardjs.com/) which we may want to follow. We'll have to have further discussions as a team on the standards around JS.

If not covered yet in this documentation, as a default refer to [Google's documentation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html).
