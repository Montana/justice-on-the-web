# Javascript


Our team follows the  [JS standard](https://standardjs.com/). 

When building JS components the whole component should be written in same format e.g. If jQuery is used then this should be consistent throughout the component code. 

We also use [ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp)

## JS Libraries
   
Our team has an agreed list of third party JS Libraries (link to be added) that we use.

## Github Actions

Our team will implement [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) so that any Javascript that is committed to our repo's is optimised and formatted to our agreed standard before being pushed to production 


## Standard JS Components

Where possible we use the same JS component to provide specific functionality across all our website.

These are components that we have built as well as from [GDS](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/) (where possible).
